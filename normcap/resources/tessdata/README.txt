NormCap's tessdata-folder
=========================

This folder contains Tesseract language data files (*.traineddata). They were
created and maintained by the Tesseract contributors, all credit belongs to them!

These files are used by NormCap. They have either been shipped with a prebuild package
or were installed by the user. If you don't use NormCap anymore, it is safe to remove
this folder!

If you need more information about the properties of the different data files, please
consult their documentation first:
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_fast/blob/4.1.0/README.md

It is not recommended for the average user, but if you really need better character
recognition, you can try the larger & slower models by downloading them _manually_ from:
- https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata
- https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata_best
